# ID3-Implementation-from-scratch
1. Introduction
This project demonstrates how to implement the ID3 algorithm from scratch in Python. It includes preprocessing steps, implementation details, and application on multiple datasets to showcase the performance and functionality of the algorithm.

2. Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
3. Datasets
The project utilizes four famous datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

Breast Cancer Wisconsin
Car Evaluation
Ecoli
Letter Recognition
Ensure you have these datasets downloaded and accessible in your working directory.

4. Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary datasets in the specified directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook ID3_All_Datasets.ipynb.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the data, implement the ID3 algorithm, and evaluate the results.
5. ID3 Algorithm
The implementation of the ID3 algorithm involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical features.
Entropy Calculation: Measuring the uncertainty in a dataset.
Information Gain Calculation: Determining the best attribute to split the data based on entropy.
Tree Construction: Recursively splitting the dataset until the stopping criteria are met.
6. Results
The results section provides the accuracy and performance of the ID3 algorithm on each dataset.

ID3 Algorithm Performance Summary:

Dataset	ID3 Accuracy
Breast Cancer	0.91
Car Evaluation	0.63
Ecoli	0.52
Letter	0.42
